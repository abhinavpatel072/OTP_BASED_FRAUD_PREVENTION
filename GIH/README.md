In contemporary India, a growing threat lurks in the form  of  fraudulent  calls  targeting  unsuspecting individuals. Scammers employ manipulative tactics, posing as legitimate entities to instill fear by falsely claiming that the victim's bank account is at risk of being  blocked.

In the digital age, it is crucial for individuals  to  remain  vigilant,  recognizing  such schemes    and    safeguarding    their    financial information from these nefarious actors.
